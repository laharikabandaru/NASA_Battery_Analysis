# NASA_Battery_Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the NASA Battery Dataset, focusing on how battery parameters such as **test_id**, **electrolyte resistance (Re)**, and **charge transfer resistance (Rct)** change with aging through charge/discharge cycles. The analysis uses Plotly for visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [NASA Battery Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickfleith/nasa-battery-dataset/data)
- The dataset contains measurements of Li-ion batteries under various operational profiles, including charge, discharge, and impedance tests.

## Objectives
- Visualize how battery aging impacts:
  1. Test_id.
  2. Electrolyte resistance (Re).
  3. Charge transfer resistance (Rct).

## Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `plotly`

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (they are installed automatically in the notebook).
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to the notebook, or update the dataset path.
4. Run the cells sequentially.

## Results
- Interactive visualizations were created to track changes in battery parameters over time.
